Put the additional WAV sound files into this folder with any filename.

After restarting the application, they will appear as selectable list on the user interface of pomodoro timer.

Signed 16 bit PCM, 8000,...,44100 hertz, mono or stereo files are ok(tried on my system). It depends on Java audio library and the soundcard.

By default, the only tick sound file named "tick.wav" is included in the application executable.

If you put an another tick.wav into this folder, you will hear it after selecting from list, not the builtin one.

Also, this folder contains the reduced quality(LQ) of some tick sound wav files. They are listed below with their original source URL and license info:
