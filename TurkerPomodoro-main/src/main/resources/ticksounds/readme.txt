Put the additional WAV sound files into this folder with any filename.

After restarting the application, they will appear as selectable list on the user interface of pomodoro timer.

16 bit, 44100 hertz stereo files are ok.

By default, the only tick sound file "tick.wav" is included in the application executable.
If you put an another tick.wav into this folder, you will hear it after selecting from list, not the builtin one.
