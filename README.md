# Current Status of the Software

Use in an empty folder to avoid overwriting files named notes.png, notes.txt, playlist1.txt, playlist2.txt, and playlist3.txt.

This software is still under development and, while it is functional for my own use, it may have missing features or usability issues that could make it difficult for others to use effectively.

There is currently no detailed user guide, and some parts of the application may not be intuitive for first-time users. However, the overall design and interface seen in the current version are expected to remain largely the same in future updates.

The primary goal moving forward is to improve stability, fix bugs, and complete missing features to provide a more seamless experience. User feedback is always welcome, but please keep in mind that the software is still evolving.

### Direct Download

[!IMPORTANT]
BUG FIX: You need to make pomodoro.timer.autoplay.is.enabled=0 in config.properties file. Open the software, create config.properties file from user interface, close the program, change the value from 1 to 0 in config file. Start the program. Then pomodoro timer will work correctly.

Use it in an empty folder! Because it can overwrite some files with the same name, if they exist.
